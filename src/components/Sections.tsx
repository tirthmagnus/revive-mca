const FAQS = [
  { q: "What is merchant cash advance debt relief?", a: "It generally refers to strategies intended to address commercial MCA obligations through negotiated changes, restructuring, settlement, or other business-specific approaches. The available options depend on the agreements, balances, cash flow, creditor participation, and applicable law." },
  { q: "Can my MCA payments be reduced?", a: "Possibly, but there is no universal reduction. Any modified payment or settlement requires facts specific to your situation and, where applicable, creditor agreement." },
  { q: "What if I have multiple MCAs?", a: "Multiple positions are common. A useful review looks at the combined cash-flow burden and the terms of each obligation rather than evaluating one advance in isolation." },
  { q: "How long does the process take?", a: "There is no single timeline. It varies based on the number of obligations, creditor responsiveness, your financial situation, and the strategy used." },
  { q: "Are settlements guaranteed?", a: "No. Creditor participation and outcomes are not guaranteed, and no specific savings amount, percentage, or timeline should be assumed before your case is reviewed." },
  { q: "Is this for personal credit-card debt?", a: "No. Revive MCA is positioned for businesses and commercial obligations, not consumer or personal debt relief." },
  { q: "What should I have ready for a consultation?", a: "Recent MCA agreements, payment information, approximate balances, and a high-level picture of business revenue are useful. Do not send SSNs, bank passwords, or payment card numbers through the public website." },
